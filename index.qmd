I am an economist working at the intersection of finance, economics, and climate change. I analyse and visualize data using R.

Currently, I am working for the [OECD](https://www.oecd.org/). My research and policy work focuses on aligning finance with climate policy goals under the OECD's [Research Collaborative on Tracking Finance for Climate Action](https://www.oecd.org/env/researchcollaborative/) (please find a summary of our work [here](https://www.oecd.org/climate-change/oecd-research-collaborative-finance-climate-action-brochure.pdf)). At the OECD, I have also researched the impacts of the net-zero transition on firms, cities and rural regions.

Previously, I worked for the [Transition Pathway Initiative](https://www.transitionpathwayinitiative.org/) (at the LSE's [GRI](https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/)) analysing companies' preparedness to transition to a low carbon economy. [Investors use this research as a tool for climate action.](https://www.climateaction100.org/progress/progress-update/)
