    "text": "Abstract\nThis paper analyses existing methodologies developed by commercial services providers, research institutes or civil society organisations for investors and financial institutions, to assess the alignment of their assets and portfolios with the Paris Agreement temperature goal. The analysis is based on four main analytical dimensions - coverage of financial asset classes, choice of greenhouse gas performance metrics, selection of climate change mitigation scenarios, and approach for aggregating alignment assessment for a given asset class and at portfolio level. Within these dimensions, the analysis highlights that a range of different and complex methodological choices, as well as current scope and data limitations, impact the environmental integrity and policy relevance of alignment or misalignment results. The paper provides suggestions for improved and more comprehensive financial sector alignment assessment. These include the development of different complementary methodologies to cover a broader range of financial asset classes than the current main focus on listed corporate equity, the development of more tailored mitigation scenarios by climate policy and science communities, better communication of uncertainties by all stakeholders, and the need for a series of indicators to assess progress and impacts that include but are not limited to GHG based alignment assessments."

This report explores key challenges and opportunities related to the transparency, specificity and integrity of metrics to support the monitoring of financial institutions’ net-zero commitments. It provides an assessment of metrics put forward in five voluntary frameworks, identifies the type of information and metrics proposed, their common themes and gaps, as well as limitations in underlying methodological guidance that may hinder financial institutions’ ability to report and disclose metrics. The report highlights a need both for continued efforts to develop robust metrics and incentivise improved data disclosure, as well as for international co-operation to reduce fragmentation and provide further transparency on the scope of metrics and underlying methodologies."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe oil and gas (O&G) industry faces an existential threat from the transition to a low-carbon economy. Companies are increasingly responding by setting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions targets, which are presented as being compatible with this transition. Many stakeholders, including investors that own O&G companies, want to understand how ambitious these targets are. In this paper, we present a forward-looking method of estimating the life-cycle carbon emissions intensity of O&G producers based on their public disclosures, and we use it to compare companies’ targets with international climate goals. The sector is not on track. Recent trends in emissions intensity have been mostly flat. Nearly half the companies we assess have yet to set emissions targets or provide sufficient clarity on them. Of those that have set targets, most are either too shallow or too narrow. Two companies have set targets that would bring their GHG intensity below international climate goals by mid-century."

Amidst risks of delayed action and greenwashing, there is need to understand whether climate related targets and transition plans are consistent with the Paris Agreement. Climate change mitigation scenarios can be used as inputs to design such targets and plans, and as benchmarks to assess progress towards them. In this context, this paper proposes criteria for selecting global climate change mitigation scenarios that can be considered consistent with the Paris Agreement temperature goal and emissions objectives, based on state-of-the-art literature on climate science and mitigation scenarios."

    "text": "Abstract\nSome manufacturing activities are among the most difficult human activities to make climate neutral and they are typically regionally concentrated. Across Europe these regions are often socioeconomically relatively weak. Yet these sectors provide relatively well-paid jobs in many of these regions. Some of these regions may also have more difficult access to infrastructure to provide the hydrogen, carbon capture and storage and zero-emission freight, which can be important to some of these activities. Industrial transitions to climate neutrality therefore have regional development implications. Since regions differ in their socio-economic conditions, understanding these regional development implications will help policy makers prepare a just transition. This publication identifies manufacturing activities that are particularly difficult to decarbonise and the transformations they require. It shows how these activities are distributed across European regions, focusing on employment at emission-intensive production locations. It identifies conditions for getting access to needed infrastructure and how access conditions differ across regions. It investigates the socio-economic vulnerabilities of affected regions, their manufacturing businesses and workers. In some regions, workers and firms may be particularly vulnerable, for example, because of low-skill jobs, type of employment contract or low productivity."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe substantial global upheavals of recent years have come at a time of unprecedented urgency for faster action on climate change. Addressing this challenge is the focus of Net Zero+: Climate and Economic Resilience in a Changing World. The project draws on the breadth of the OECD’s multidisciplinary expertise to present resilience as the backbone of effective, whole-of-government climate policy. Net Zero+ is about how we reach net zero in a rapidly changing world – it is about not only making sure climate policies are as ambitious as they need to be but also resilient in a world of overlapping disruptions. This means building resilience to the impacts of climate change itself, as well as designing policies that fully take into account socio-economic implications and considerations of fairness and equity. This report is the final output of the first phase of this project."

It also presents tools to improve the credibility and uptake of transition planning, encompassing carbon-intensive activities and projects that need to undergo significant decarbonization or phase-out.
