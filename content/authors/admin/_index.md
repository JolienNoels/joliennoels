I am an economist interested in anything at the intersection of climate change, finance and regional analysis. I analyse and visualize data using R. 

Currently, I am working for the {{< staticref "https://www.oecd.org" "newtab" >}}OECD{{< /staticref >}} (for the Finance, Investment and Global Relations division). My research and policy work focuses on aligning finance with climate policy goals under the OECD's {{< staticref "https://www.oecd.org/env/researchcollaborative/" "newtab" >}}Research Collaborative on Tracking Finance for Climate Action{{< /staticref >}} (please find a summary of our work {{< staticref "https://www.oecd.org/climate-change/oecd-research-collaborative-finance-climate-action-brochure.pdf" "newtab" >}}here{{< /staticref >}}). At the OECD, I have also researched the impacts of the net-zero transition on firms, cities and rural regions (for the {{< staticref "https://www.oecd.org/cfe/" "newtab" >}}CFE{{< /staticref >}}'s Economic Analysis, Data and Statistics division). 

Previously, I worked for the {{< staticref "https://www.transitionpathwayinitiative.org" "newtab">}}Transition Pathway Initiative{{< /staticref >}} (at the LSE's {{< staticref "https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/" "newtab" >}}GRI{{< /staticref >}}) analysing companies' preparedness to transition to a low carbon economy. {{< staticref "https://climateaction100.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/progressreport2019.pdf" "newtab" >}}Investors use this research as a tool for climate action.{{< /staticref >}}
