I am an economist interested in anything at the intersection of climate change, finance and regional analysis. I analyse and visualize data using R. 

I am currently working for the {{< staticref "https://www.oecd.org" "newtab" >}}OECD{{< /staticref >}} (in the CFE's Economic Analysis, Data and Statistics division) researching the net zero transition from a regional/urban perspective. Previously, I worked for the {{< staticref "https://www.transitionpathwayinitiative.org" "newtab">}}Transition Pathway Initiative{{< /staticref >}} (at the LSE's {{< staticref "https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/" "newtab" >}}GRI{{< /staticref >}}) analysing companies' preparedness to transition to a low carbon economy. {{< staticref "https://climateaction100.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/progressreport2019.pdf" "newtab" >}}Investors use this research as a tool for climate action.{{< /staticref >}}
