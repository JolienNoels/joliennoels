abstract: I study the effects of air pollution on local temperature in Chinese cities using NASA satellite data. An indirect effect of air pollution through the urban heat island effect (UHI) is studied through a novel estimation technique of the UHI. I also show that air pollutionâ€™s effect has been impacted by Chinese anti-pollution policies. Finally, I show that air pollution has a stronger effect on urban areas than rural areas (holding all else equal).
